# Test Plan for `kanuka secrets remove` Command

This document outlines the testing strategy for the `kanuka secrets remove` command, which is used to remove a user's access to the secret store.

## 1. Basic Functionality Tests

### 1.1 Command Flag Requirements
- **Test:** `TestRemoveCommand_RequiresUserFlag`
- **Description:** Verify that the command requires the `--user` flag to be specified.
- **Expected Outcome:** Command should show an error message when the `--user` flag is not provided.

### 1.2 User Not Found
- **Test:** `TestRemoveCommand_UserNotFound`
- **Description:** Verify that the command handles the case when the specified user does not exist.
- **Expected Outcome:** Command should show a message indicating that the user does not exist.

### 1.3 Successful Removal
- **Test:** `TestRemoveCommand_SuccessfulRemoval`
- **Description:** Verify that the command successfully removes a user's access files.
- **Expected Outcome:** Both the public key file and kanuka key file should be removed.

## 2. Filesystem Edge Cases

### 2.1 Only Public Key File Exists
- **Test:** `TestRemoveWithOnlyPublicKeyFile`
- **Description:** Verify that the command works correctly when only the public key file exists.
- **Expected Outcome:** The public key file should be removed and the command should succeed.

### 2.2 Only Kanuka Key File Exists
- **Test:** `TestRemoveWithOnlyKanukaKeyFile`
- **Description:** Verify that the command works correctly when only the kanuka key file exists.
- **Expected Outcome:** The kanuka key file should be removed and the command should succeed.

### 2.3 Read-Only Files
- **Test:** `TestRemoveWithReadOnlyPublicKeyFile`
- **Description:** Verify that the command handles the case when files have read-only permissions.
- **Expected Outcome:** The command should attempt to remove the files and report any errors.

## 3. Project State Requirements

### 3.1 Without Initialization
- **Test:** `TestRemoveWithoutInitialization`
- **Description:** Verify that the command requires the project to be initialized.
- **Expected Outcome:** Command should show a message indicating that the project needs to be initialized.

### 3.2 Non-Kanuka Project
- **Test:** `TestRemoveInNonKanukaProject`
- **Description:** Verify that the command requires a valid kanuka project structure.
- **Expected Outcome:** Command should show a message indicating that the project is not a valid kanuka project.

## 4. Integration Tests

### 4.1 Full Workflow
- **Test:** `TestRemoveUserAfterRegistration`
- **Description:** Test the full workflow of initializing a project, registering a user, and then removing that user.
- **Expected Outcome:** The user should be successfully registered and then removed, with all files properly created and then deleted.

## 5. Potential Additional Tests (Future Work)

### 5.1 Multiple Users
- **Description:** Test removing one user from a project with multiple users.
- **Expected Outcome:** Only the specified user's files should be removed, leaving other users' files intact.

### 5.2 Permission Denied
- **Description:** Test the command's behavior when the user doesn't have permission to remove files.
- **Expected Outcome:** The command should show appropriate error messages.

### 5.3 Concurrent Access
- **Description:** Test the command's behavior when files are being accessed by another process.
- **Expected Outcome:** The command should handle file locking issues gracefully.

### 5.4 Large Number of Users
- **Description:** Test the command's performance with a large number of users.
- **Expected Outcome:** The command should perform efficiently even with many users.

## 6. Test Coverage

The current test suite covers:
- Basic functionality (command flags, user not found, successful removal)
- Filesystem edge cases (partial files, read-only files)
- Project state requirements (initialization, valid project structure)
- Integration with other commands (init, register)

## 7. Known Limitations

- The tests do not currently verify the behavior when removing the current user.
- The tests do not verify the behavior when removing the last user from a project.
- The tests do not verify the behavior with very long usernames or special characters in usernames.
