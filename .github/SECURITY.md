# Kānuka Security Policy

Kānuka is an independent project. We appreciate fellow developers, bug hunters,
security researchers, and anyone generous enough with their time and attention
too let us know if something is broken, or falls short of best practice.

Please report serious bugs, annoyances and feature suggestions as GitHub issues.
(For extra brownie points, do a quick search to see if there‘s already an
existing issue!) Kānuka is developed in the open, and this includes management
and triage of issues; so your contributions here are most welcome.

If you think you’ve uncovered a critical security vulnerability, please contact
list-12shadow@icloud.com. Thank you for your help with responsibly disclosing
these issues.
