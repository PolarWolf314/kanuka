the event of a security breach you may want to revoke all access _and_ rewrite
version control history to remove all references to Kﾄ］uka.

## Purging secrets

Purging secrets is a destructive action and rewrites all version control
history. To do it, run the following command.

```bash
kanuka secrets purge

# Then confirm the safety prompt by typing CONFIRM
```

That's it! Kﾄ］uka will revoke all access and purge the version control history
of any references to Kﾄ］uka.
