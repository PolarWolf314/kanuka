description: Introduction to Kﾄ］uka's development environment management system
---

Grove is Kﾄ］uka's development environment management system that provides reproducible, isolated development environments using the Nix ecosystem and devenv.

## Overview

Grove solves the "it works on my machine" problem by creating declarative, reproducible development environments that work consistently across different systems and team members.

## Key Benefits

- **Reproducible**: Same environment everywhere, every time
- **Isolated**: No conflicts with system packages or other projects
- **Declarative**: Environment defined in code (devenv.nix)
- **Fast**: Leverages Nix's binary cache for quick setup
- **Flexible**: Support for any language or tool available in nixpkgs

## How Grove Works

Grove integrates with the devenv ecosystem to provide:

1. **Environment Definition**: Uses `devenv.nix` to declare your development environment
2. **Package Management**: Integrates with nixpkgs for access to thousands of packages
3. **Shell Integration**: Provides clean, isolated development shells
4. **Container Support**: Build OCI containers from your development environment
5. **Channel Management**: Control nixpkgs versions and package sources

## Core Concepts

### devenv.nix
The heart of your development environment - a Nix file that declaratively defines all packages, languages, and services needed for your project.

### kanuka.toml
Kﾄ］uka's configuration file that tracks Grove-managed packages and settings.

### Channels
Different versions of the nixpkgs package repository (stable, unstable, or custom) that provide different package versions.
