title: What is Grove?
description: Introduction to Kﾄ］uka's development environment management system
---

Grove is Kﾄ］uka's solution to the "it works on my machine" problem. It creates development environments that work exactly the same way on every computer, every time.

## What Grove does for you

Grove solves those frustrating moments when code works perfectly on your machine but breaks on your teammate's computer, or when you spend hours setting up dependencies for a new project.

## Why Grove is great

- **Reproducible**: You get the same environment everywhere, every time
- **Isolated**: No conflicts with your system packages or other projects
- **Declarative**: Your environment is defined in code (devenv.nix) that you can version control
- **Fast**: Uses Nix's binary cache so setup is quick
- **Flexible**: Access to thousands of packages and tools from nixpkgs

## How Grove works

Grove uses the devenv ecosystem to give you:

1. **Environment Definition**: Uses `devenv.nix` to declare what's in your development environment
2. **Package Management**: Access to thousands of packages from nixpkgs
3. **Shell Integration**: Clean, isolated development shells
4. **Container Support**: Build containers from your development environment
5. **Channel Management**: Control which versions of packages you get

## The key concepts

### devenv.nix
This is the heart of your development environment - a file that defines all the packages, languages, and services your project needs.

### kanuka.toml
Kﾄ］uka's own configuration file that keeps track of what Grove has added to your environment.

### Channels
Different versions of the package repository (stable, unstable, or custom) that give you different package versions.
