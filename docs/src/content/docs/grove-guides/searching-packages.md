description: A guide to discovering available packages for your Grove environment using KƒÅnuka.

With thousands of packages available in the Nix ecosystem, finding the right one can be challenging. Grove provides search functionality to help you discover what's available.

:::tip
Grove searches the entire nixpkgs repository, which contains over 100,000 packages including programming languages, development tools, databases, and more!

## Searching for packages

To search for packages by name:

```bash
kanuka grove search nodejs
kanuka grove search python
kanuka grove search postgres
```

This will show you all packages that match your search term, along with their descriptions.

## Search examples

Here are some useful search patterns:

```bash
# Find all Node.js related packages
kanuka grove search node

# Find Python packages
kanuka grove search python

# Find database packages
kanuka grove search database

# Find development tools
kanuka grove search dev

# Find specific tools
kanuka grove search docker
kanuka grove search git
kanuka grove search vim
```

## Understanding search results

Search results typically show:
- **Package name**: The exact name to use with `kanuka grove add`.
- **Description**: What the package does.
- **Version**: The current version available.

## Finding the right package

When searching, you might find multiple related packages:

```bash
kanuka grove search node
# Results might include:
# - nodejs (latest Node.js)
# - nodejs_18 (Node.js version 18)
# - nodejs_16 (Node.js version 16)
# - node2nix (tool for Node.js packages)
```

Choose the one that best fits your needs. For most cases, the main package name (like `nodejs`) gives you the latest stable version.

## What if you can't find a package?

If you can't find what you're looking for:

1. **Try different search terms**: Search for variations or related terms.
2. **Check the package name**: Some packages have unexpected names in nixpkgs.
3. **Look for alternatives**: There might be a similar tool with a different name.
4. **Use channels**: Try searching in different channels if you need specific versions.
