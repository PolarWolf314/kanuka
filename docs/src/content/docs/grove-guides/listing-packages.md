description: A guide to viewing what's currently installed in your Grove environment using KƒÅnuka.
---

It's useful to see what packages and languages are currently available in your Grove environment. This helps you understand what tools you have and plan any changes.

:::tip
Grove tracks everything you've added, so you can always see exactly what's in your environment without guessing or remembering what you installed!
:::

## Listing your packages

To see what's currently in your environment:

```bash
kanuka grove list
```

This shows you:
- All packages you've added.
- All language environments you've enabled.
- Which channel each package comes from.

## Understanding the output

The list output typically shows:

```
Packages:
- nodejs_18 (from nixpkgs-unstable)
- python3 (from nixpkgs-unstable)
- git (from nixpkgs-unstable)

Languages:
- typescript (enabled)
- rust (enabled)
```

## Checking specific categories

You can also check specific types of additions:

```bash
# List only packages
kanuka grove list --packages

# List only languages
kanuka grove list --languages
```

## Viewing detailed information

For more detailed information about your environment:

```bash
kanuka grove list --verbose
```

This might show additional details like:
- Package versions.
- Dependency information.
- Configuration details.

## Comparing with what's available

You can combine listing with searching to plan changes:

```bash
# See what you have
kanuka grove list

# Search for something new
kanuka grove search database

# Add what you need
kanuka grove add postgresql
```

## Checking environment files

You can also check your environment by looking at the configuration files:

- `kanuka.toml` - Shows what Grove has tracked.
- `devenv.nix` - Shows the full environment definition.
