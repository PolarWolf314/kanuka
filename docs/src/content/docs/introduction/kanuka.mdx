description: What is Kānuka?
---

Kānuka is a powerful CLI tool written in Go that unifies development environment management and secure secrets sharing. It provides reproducible development environments using the Nix ecosystem, comprehensive package management, container support, and industry-standard encryption for team secrets.

With Kānuka, you'll never need to ask "what tools do I need installed?" or "can you send me the API keys?" again. Create isolated, reproducible development environments and securely share secrets across your entire team.

## What’s with the name?

Kānuka (<i>Kunzea ericoides</i>) is a tree that is endemic to Aotearoa New
Zealand. It is a robust species, critical to restoring wildlife destroyed by
fire as it quickly propagates and regenerates the land. Its leaves have a
characteristically soft touch, and it’s one of few plants that can survive the
heat of geothermal features.

It is fast, resilient, yet pleasant to touch. This is the vision of Kānuka.

## Core Features

### Grove (Development Environment Management)

- **Channel Management**: Control nixpkgs versions and pin specific commits.
- **Container Support**: Build OCI containers directly from your development environment.
- **AWS Integration**: Built-in AWS SSO authentication for seamless cloud development.

### Secrets Management
- **Secure Encryption**: Industry-standard AES-256 and RSA-2048 encryption.
- **Team Collaboration**: Register team members and share secrets securely.
- **Git-Safe**: Encrypted secrets can be safely committed to version control.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

You'll need to have Go installed first, and have the Go binaries available on
your system path. Check the [Go installation documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install)
if you haven't installed Go already.

It's also worth making sure that you have your Go binaries on your system path.
The Go installation tool should handle that for you, but if you installed Go
through a different way (for example, using a package manager like `brew`),
then you'll need to manually put Go in your path.
