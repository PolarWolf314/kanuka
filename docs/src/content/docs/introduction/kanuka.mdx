description: What is Kānuka?
---

Kānuka is a CLI tool written in Go. It makes sharing secrets, creating
development environments, deploying code, and testing, unified under one robust
and simple interface. Never again will you need to ask another developer to send
you their `.env` file, or what tools need to be installed on your system in
order to start developing.

The current scope of the project only encompasses secrets managements right now.

## What’s with the name?

Kānuka (<i>Kunzea ericoides</i>) is a tree that is endemic to Aotearoa New
Zealand. It is a robust species, critical to restoring wildlife destroyed by
fire as it quickly propagates and regenerates the land. Its leaves have a
characteristically soft touch, and it’s one of few plants that can survive the
heat of geothermal features.

It is fast, resilient, yet pleasant to touch. This is the vision of Kānuka.

## Installation

You'll need to have Go installed first, and have the Go binaries available on
your system path. Check the [Go installation documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install)
if you haven't installed Go already.

It's also worth making sure that you have your Go binaries on your system path.
The Go installation tool should handle that for you, but if you installed Go
through a different way (for example, using a package manager like `brew`),
then you'll need to manually put Go in your path.

##### Adding Go to your PATH
