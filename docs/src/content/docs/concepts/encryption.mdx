title: Encryption and Decryption
description: An explanation for how Kānuka actually works.
---

Kānuka uses open standards for encryption, and all the code is [open
source](https://github.com/PolarWolf314/kanuka). For the symmetric key, Kānuka
uses the [AES 256-bit
standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard). For the
public/private key pair, Kānuka uses the [RSA 2048-bit
standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem). Both these standards
are used widely across the internet. RSA is used any time you browse the
internet with an HTTPS connection, while AES is used whenever you are logged
into the Wi-Fi router.

## How does Kānuka work?

Here is the basic workflow for encryption, assuming you have access:

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Kānuka will search your entire repo for every file that has `.env` in the
   name, but not `.kanuka`.
2. Kānuka will then use your private key to decrypt your symmetric key that
   resides in `project_root/.kanuka/secrets/your_username.kanuka`.
3. Kānuka will use that decrypted symmetric key to encrypt every file found in
   step 1.
4. Kānuka will then name those files exactly the same, just with `.kanuka`
   added onto the end.

</Steps>

For decryption, the same is done just in reverse. Instead of searching for all
`.env` files, it will search for all `.kanuka` files.

## Why is this secure?

Kānuka is secure because all sensitive information is only ever in memory or on
your local device.

These are — in broad strokes — what ends up happening during an encryption and
decryption process.

Unlike the typical math equation where you can go forwards and back, modern
cryptographic techniques are created in such a way that the processes shown in
the image above _only ever work in one direction_.
