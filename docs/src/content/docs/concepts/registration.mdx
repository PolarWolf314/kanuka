title: Registration and Removal
description: An explanation for how Kānuka registers and removes other users.

When a new user joins the project for the first time, they will not have access
to the system — it would be a bit concerning if they did! The diagram below
demonstrates the missing piece for a new user, assuming they have already ran
`kanuka secrets create` and committed their changes to version control.

When a user with access runs:

```bash
# Using the example's username
kanuka secrets register --user user_2
```

Kānuka does the following two steps:

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Kānuka will decrypt `user_1`'s encrypted AES key.
2. Kānuka will then use the symmetric key and combine it with `user_2`'s public
   key.

</Steps>

## How does Kānuka handle both OpenSSH and PEM format?

If the RSA encryption standard is like a destination, OpenSSH and PEM are the
different ways to get there. At the end of the day, they are both
representations of the same thing. Under the hood, Kānuka converts everything
to PEM format before using or storing it.

:::tip
The discussion around these two formats are a [bit more
nuanced](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/143114/what-is-the-difference-between-pem-format-to-dsa-rsa-ecc-might-i-confuse-pem-w).
RSA is just one of many encryption standards. Other algorithms include ed25519
(an algorithm based on elliptic curves, which is the OpenSSH default now), and
DSA (used for digital signing).

In truth, Kānuka only supports **RSA** at the moment.

## How does Kānuka remove other users?

By simply deleting a user's encrypted AES key and their public key, that user
will no longer have access to the secrets, and no other user can accidentally
give them access again.
