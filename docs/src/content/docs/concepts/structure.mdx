title: Where Kānuka Stores Your Files
description: An explanation for the project structure and file organization.
---

Kānuka creates different files depending on which features you're using. Understanding where everything goes helps you work effectively with the tool.

## Secrets Management Files

Kānuka stores all your secrets-related files in a `.kanuka` folder at the root
of your project. For example, if you had an Astro project, it may look like
this:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>

- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
- .env your secrets, which should be in .gitignore
- .env.kanuka your secrets, encrypted by Kānuka
- src
  - components/
  - pages/
- **.kanuka**
  - public_keys
    - user_1.pub
    - user_2.pub
  - secrets
    - user_1.kanuka
    - user_2.kanuka

</FileTree>

## What Gets Committed

All files created by Kānuka are safe to commit to version control, except:

- Private keys (stored in your user directory).

A core concept to understand is that each user has _their own_ version of a
symmetric key, but everyone has the _same_ symmetric key. To read more about
how encryption and decryption works, check out the [encryption concepts
page](/concepts/encryption).

:::caution[Note]
There are plans in the future to include a configuration file as well, which
would help identify both users and project names. We are well aware of
potential namespace clashes, so sit tight!

## User specific files

Of course, to decrypt a file that has been encrypted by an RSA key pair, the
user will need to have their matching private key. By default, the private keys
are stored at `XDG_DATA_HOME` (which defaults to `~/.local/share/kanuka/` for
UNIX-like systems, and `%APPDATA%\kanuka\` on Windows).

They look like this:

<FileTree>

- kanuka at `~/.local/share/kanuka` or equivalent
  - keys
    - project_one this is a private key for project_one
    - project_one.pub the corresponding public key
    - project_two
    - project_two.pub

</FileTree>

Kānuka will reach into your `XDG_DATA_HOME` and find the correct private key,
and use that to decrypt your version of the symmetric key.

decrypts files.
