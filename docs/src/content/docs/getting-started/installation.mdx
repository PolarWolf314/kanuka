description: How to install Kānuka.
---

Feel free to install Kānuka using any of the following methods, although
installing using Go itself is recommended.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Go installed first, and have the Go binaries available on
your system path. Check the [Go installation documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install)
if you haven't installed Go already.

It's also worth making sure that you have your Go binaries on your system path.
The Go installation tool should handle that for you, but if you installed Go
through a different way (for example, using a package manager like `brew`),
then you'll need to manually put Go in your path.

##### Adding Go to your PATH

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    <Code
      code="# add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`
      export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
      lang="bash"
      title="~/.bashrc"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
    <Code
      code="# add the following line to your `~/.zshrc`
      export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
      lang="zsh"
      title="~/.zshrc"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    1. Press `win + s` and type `Environment Variables`
    2. Click on `Environment Variables`
    3. Under "user variables", click *edit*.
    4. Add the following:

    <Code code="%USERPROFILE%\go\bin" title="user variables" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Installing Kānuka using Go

On any operating system, just run the following:

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Code
  code="go install https://github.com/PolarWolf314/kanuka@latest"
  lang="bash"
/>

### Installing Kānuka using GitHub Releases

Kānuka releases artifacts which can be downloaded directly from [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/PolarWolf314/kanuka/releases).

Each release page includes the binaries for all supported platforms.

## Upgrading Kānuka

If you installed Kānuka using Go, then running the following should be enough:

<Code
  code="go install github.com/PolarWolf314/kanuka@latest"
  lang="bash"
/>

If you installed Kānuka using a GitHub Release, just navigate to the [GitHub
Releases page](https://github.com/PolarWolf314/kanuka/releases), and install
your existing binary with the newest version.

## Shell Autocomplete

Because Kānuka is built using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), shell
autocomplete is supported for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, and `powershell`.

:::tip
You can run `echo $SHELL` to help determine your shell.
:::

import bashCompletionCode from "../../../code/bash-completions.txt?raw"
import zshCompletionCode from "../../../code/zsh-completions.txt?raw"
import fishCompletionCode from "../../../code/fish-completions.txt?raw"
import powershellCompletionCode from "../../../code/powershell-completions.txt?raw"

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="bash">
    <Code
      lang="bash"
      code={bashCompletionCode}
    />
  </TabItem>
<TabItem label="zsh">
  <Code
    lang="zsh"
    code={zshCompletionCode}
    />
</TabItem>

{" "}
<TabItem label="fish">
  <Code
    lang="bash"
    code={fishCompletionCode}
  />
</TabItem>

  <TabItem label="powershell">
    Add the following to your `powershell` profile.
    <Code
      lang="powershell"
      code={powershellCompletionCode}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Uninstalling

You need to manually remove the Kānuka binary from your system. If you used `go
install` to install Kānuka, then you can just go to the folder where your
binaries are installed, and remove the binary.

:::tip
You can run `echo $GOBIN` to find out where your binaries are installed.
:::

If you installed using a GitHub Release, then remove the binary from where you
installed it.

:::caution[Note]
You may also want to remove all your related Kānuka files. These will be stored
in `XDG_DATA_HOME` and in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (or your operating system
equivalent).
